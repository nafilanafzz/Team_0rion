								<h1>SYZYGY </h1>
								<p>Solar and lunar eclipses take place when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned. This type
of event is also called a syzygy. During a solar eclipse, the Moon blocks the view of the
Sun as seen from Earth. Solar eclipses can be central or partial. Lunar eclipses happen
when Earth positions itself between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow across the
lunar surface. it can only occur during a full moon and are a popular event for skywatchers
worldwide as they do not require any specialist equipment to enjoy (unlike solar eclipses).</p>

								<h1>Tales of Eclipse</h1>
								<p>*As per Hindu mythology ,the sun and the moon from time to time,are seized and
swallowed by a demon named Rahu and his detached body known as Keth.This is
because solar and lunar eclipses occur.
*The ancient people were unaware of the scientific reasons for eclipses and generally
believed that it was the punishment or wrath of God's over them.
*In China, people believed that a fire dog tried to swallow the sun from heaven which
resulted in eclipses.
*In Benin,belief says that an eclipse occurs when there was a fight between the Sun
and the Moon .To reconcile the Sun and the Moon, people used to solve their
persistent issues with each other.</p>
