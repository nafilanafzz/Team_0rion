					<h2>ECLIPSARIX</h2>
					<p>Earth, our home planet, is locked in an elliptical path around the sun. This elliptical
path is known as the orbit of our planet. Earth travels around the sun along that orbit
and completes one revolution in approximately 365 days and 6 hours. This is roughly
the length of one year.
Just as Earth moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit every year, our natural
satellite the moon also revolves around the Earth. It takes about 27.322 days for the
moon to complete one revolution around ourDue to all the interrelated motion happening between these three celestial bodies,
several physical phenomena occur.that's why solar and lunar eclipses occur. .</p>
					<p>There is not an eclipse every month because the moon's orbit is usually tilted a few
degrees north or south in relation to the Earth.
A lunar eclipse occurs when the earth blocks some or all of the sun's direct light from
reaching the moon. This cosmic event only takes place during a full moon, which
happens once every 29 and a half days, or the length of one full orbit of the moon
around the earth. However, the moon's orbit is tilted a few degrees in relation to the
earth, so the earth, moon, and sun don't always align perfectly, resulting in not having
an eclipse every month.Explore.</p>
